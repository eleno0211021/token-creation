# PARES Token Smart Contract

The main purpose of this code is to provide a practical way to test ones understanding of Solidity basics and token creation/minting. By interacting with this Solidity smart contract, users can reinforce their knowledge of Solidity fundamentals while gaining hands-on experience in creating and minting tokens. 

## Description

This Solidity smart contract manages the creation, tracking, and destruction of tokens. The contract provides functionalities for minting (creating) new tokens and burning (destroying) existing tokens, while also keeping track of token balances for different addresses on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To use this contract, you can deploy it directly on the Ethereum blockchain using tools like Remix or Truffle. Here's how you can deploy it using Remix:

1. Go to the Remix website at [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Create a new file and save it with a .sol extension (e.g., `MyToken.sol`).
3. Copy and paste the code from `MyToken.sol` into the Remix editor.
4. Compile the contract by clicking on the "Solidity Compiler" tab and then clicking on "Compile MyToken.sol".
5. Deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab and following the deployment process.

### Executing program

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it using Ethereum wallets or other smart contracts. Here's how you can use the contract's functions:

- Use the `mint` function to create new tokens for specific addresses.
- Use the `burn` function to destroy tokens from specific addresses.
- View token details such as the name, abbreviation, and total supply using the provided public variables.
